# Summary

Day trading is not easy to learn and not something that makes you magically rich over night.
It's just a job that needs commitment, knowledge, experiences and a lot of time.

Out of 100 people how start there day trading career only 5 will be successful and most proparly
continue with it. The rest will drop out after some big losses.

## Andrews 11 Rules of Day Trading

1. Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly.
2. Day trading is not easy. It is a serious business, and you should treat it as such.
3. Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.
4. Always ask ,"Is this stock moving because the overall market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst?"
5. Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entities with a high potential reward. *The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.
6. You broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. You cannot be a successful day trader without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.
7. Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.
8. Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.
9. Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.
10. Indicators only indicate; they should not be allowed to dictate.
11. Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.

# Personal Opinion

This book gave me a lot of great insights about what a day trader is doing all day long.

It explains certain strategies for day trading as well give examples on how this strategy was used in past trades.
This book needs certain experience and knowledge on how the stock market works in general.

Its not beginner friendly.
