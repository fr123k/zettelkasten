This book is divided into two parts. The first part is about the authors life and the principle he developed over time to help him guiding his
way through his life and the different stages of it. The second part is about the company Bridgewater and the philosophy called meritocracy that
he used to manage this company. In both parts he shares all his principles and a a detail explanation of them.

The book is quite long but its is worth to read it fully. It's inspired me to write done my own principles starting with my work principles.
