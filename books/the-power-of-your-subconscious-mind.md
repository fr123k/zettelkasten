# The Power Of Your Subconscious MIND
Author: Joseph Murphy

# Summary

The conscious mind is the motor and the subconscious mind is the engine. Use the power of the subconscious mind by give him a clear goal. This 
is done by phrasing a clear positive statement or image a scene in your conscious mind after achieving this goal.

The claim by the author is that the subconscious mind will work on achieving the goal without your attention and it will work 24 hours even
when you sleep. Because the subconscious mind never rests.

The author describe this method as Scientific Prayer. The literal meaning is that by praying to God you are speaking to your sub subconscious 
mind.

# Personal Opinion

The book use to much the word God and is to religious with the tone and the examples. But there are also scientific references about the 
subconscious mind that draw my attention on this topic.
