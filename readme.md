**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Foam Knowledge Base!**

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.
